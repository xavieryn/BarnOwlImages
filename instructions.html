<h2>Annotation Instructions: Fruit Pest Moths</h2>

<p>
  Please annotate only if you are confident in the identification.
  <strong>Do not annotate if you are unsure.</strong> False positives can harm
  model accuracy.
</p>

<h3>1. Oriental Fruit Moth (OFM)</h3>
<p>
  Look for a small moth with mottled brown wings and a slightly upturned tail.
  Often found on fruit surfaces (like peaches or apples).

<h3>2. Codling Moth (CM)</h3>
<p>
  This moth has brownish-grey forewings with dark bands or spots near the tips.
  Wings have a "coppery" sheen when light hits at an angle. It often appears
  more compact than the OFM.

<h3>3. Obliquebanded Leafroller (OBLR)</h3>
<p>
  Look for tan to reddish-brown wings with distinctive oblique (angled) dark
  bands across them. Wings are more textured or patterned than OFM or CM.

<h3>General Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only annotate the moths shown in the examples above.</li>
  <li>Skip blurry or unclear images unless the match is very clear.</li>
  <li>
    Do not annotate larvae, cocoons, or partially visible insects unless you are
    absolutely certain.
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When in doubt, leave it out.</strong></p>
